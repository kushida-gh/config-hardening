# Based on Apache httpd 2.4, fresh install on an RPM-based system


# General httpd hardening (assumes all of the following parameters have not been changed from their install defaults)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remove the version of Apache httpd in use in the HTTP server response header
sudo sed -i '1s/^/ServerTokens Prod\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Remove the httpd version information on server-generated page footers
sudo sed -i '2s/^/ServerSignature Off\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Remove entity tags (ETags) representing file inode numbers
sudo sed -i '3s/^/FileETag None\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Disable the TRACE method (plus virtually all vulnerability scanners will flag for it
sudo sed -i '4s/^/TraceEnable Off\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Cross Site Scripting protection
sudo sed -i '5s/^/Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Cross Site Scripting protection
sudo sed -i '6s/^/Header edit Set-Cookie ^(.*)$ $1;HttpOnly;Secure\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Prevent clickjacking
sudo sed -i '7s/^/Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Prevent Slow Loris DoS attacks
sudo sed -i '8s/^/Timeout 60\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Add an extra space after all of the above to separate from the rest of the httpd.conf contents
sudo sed -i '9s/^/\n/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Enable Strict Transport Security (HSTS) (assumes <VirtualHost> is not defined in the conf file yet)
sudo bash -c "echo -e >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"
sudo bash -c "echo '<VirtualHost *:443>' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"

sudo bash -c "echo '</VirtualHost>' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"



# TLS Tuning (no SSL, because that's really, really old and no one should be using it)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Note: this is just a starting point and could be made more secure, but at the risk of potentially causing connectivity 
# issues for clients which do not support modern cipher suites
sudo sed -i '1s/^/SSLProtocol -ALL +TLSv1.2\n/' /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
