# To determine which TLS versions that clients might be negotiating successfully to your host (thus seeing if versions older 
# than TLS 1.2 are being used internally), update registry so Windows will keep TLS handshake Schannel transactions.

# Set EventLogging Schannel registry entry to 0x0004 for System Log informational and success events regarding TLS negotiations.
